# Security Policy

## 🔒 Reporting a Vulnerability

The Ego Hygiene team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability in UBI, please report it through one of the following channels:

#### Preferred: GitHub Security Advisories

Report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub's Security Advisory feature:

**[Report a vulnerability →](https://github.com/egohygiene/ubi/security/advisories/new)**

This allows us to discuss the issue privately and coordinate a fix before public disclosure.

#### Alternative: Email

For sensitive issues or if you prefer email communication:

- **Email**: [security@egohygiene.com](mailto:security@egohygiene.com)
- **Subject**: Include `[SECURITY]` and a brief description (e.g., `[SECURITY] Privilege escalation in UBI base image`)

### What to Include

Please provide as much detail as possible:

- **Description**: Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential security impact and affected versions
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps or proof-of-concept
- **Environment**: Version numbers, configurations, or specific scenarios
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have recommendations (optional)

## 📦 Supported Versions

UBI follows [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/). We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Status                |
| ------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: | Current stable series |
| < 0.1.0 | :x:                | No longer supported   |

### Update Cadence

- **Security patches**: Released as soon as fixes are available (PATCH version bump)
- **Dependency updates**: Monitored continuously via Trivy and Dependabot
- **Base image updates**: Evaluated quarterly or when critical security patches are released
- **EOL policy**: Only the latest minor version receives security updates

**Recommendation**: Always use the latest version (`latest` tag) or pin to a specific version for production deployments.

## 🛡️ Security Tools Used

UBI employs multiple layers of automated security scanning:

### Container Vulnerability Scanning

**[Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)** scans the UBI container for known vulnerabilities:

- **Runs on**: Pull requests, pushes to main, and weekly (every Monday at 00:00 UTC)
- **Scans for**: OS package vulnerabilities, known CVEs from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
- **Severity threshold**: Fails CI/CD if CRITICAL or HIGH vulnerabilities are detected
- **Results**: Uploaded to [GitHub Security Tab (Code Scanning)](https://github.com/egohygiene/ubi/security/code-scanning)

View scan results: [Trivy Scan Workflow](https://github.com/egohygiene/ubi/actions/workflows/trivy-scan.yml)

### Image Signing with Cosign

**[Sigstore Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/)** cryptographically signs all published UBI images:

- **Signing Method**: Keyless signing using GitHub OIDC
- **What's Signed**: All published tags (latest, version tags, SHA digests)
- **Transparency**: Signatures recorded in public Sigstore Rekor log
- **Verification**: Anyone can verify image authenticity without needing private keys

**Verify an image:**
```bash
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp="https://github.com/egohygiene/ubi/" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  ghcr.io/egohygiene/ubi:latest
```

### Dependency Management

- **Base Image Pinning**: Upstream DevContainers base image is pinned with a digest for reproducibility
- **Automated Updates**: Regular monitoring of upstream base image releases for security patches
- **Supply Chain Security**: All dependencies are tracked and auditable

### GitHub Security Features

- **[Security Advisories](https://github.com/egohygiene/ubi/security/advisories)**: Private vulnerability reporting and coordination
- **[Security Tab](https://github.com/egohygiene/ubi/security)**: Centralized view of security alerts and scanning results
- **[Code Scanning](https://github.com/egohygiene/ubi/security/code-scanning)**: Automated vulnerability detection via Trivy

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure Policy

We kindly ask security researchers to:

1. **Report privately first**: Use GitHub Security Advisories or email before public disclosure
2. **Allow time for a fix**: Give us a reasonable timeframe to address the issue (90 days standard)
3. **Avoid exploitation**: Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what's necessary to demonstrate it
4. **Respect privacy**: Do not access, modify, or delete data belonging to others
5. **Coordinate disclosure**: Work with us on the timing and content of public disclosure

### Recognition

- We will publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- Contributors who report valid vulnerabilities may be listed in our [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)
- We do not currently offer a bug bounty program
