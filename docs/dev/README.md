# Development Documentation

This directory contains documentation for developers working on the UBI repository, including automation, tooling, and development workflows.

## Contents

- **[copilot-environment.md](./copilot-environment.md)** - GitHub Copilot Agent environment configuration and setup

## Purpose

While the main `docs/` directory focuses on using UBI as a base image, this `dev/` subdirectory focuses on:

- Developing and maintaining UBI itself
- Automation and CI/CD infrastructure
- Developer tooling and workflows
- GitHub integrations (Copilot, Actions, etc.)
