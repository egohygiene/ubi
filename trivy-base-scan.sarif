When cloning from a server (or fetching, or pushing), informational or error messages are transported from the remote Git process to the client via the so-called \"sideband channel\". These messages will be prefixed with \"remote:\" and printed directly to the standard error output. Typically, this standard error output is connected to a terminal that understands ANSI escape sequences, which Git did not protect against. Most modern terminals support control sequences that can be used by a malicious actor to hide and misrepresent information, or to mislead the user into executing untrusted scripts.

                "text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration\n\nThe bridge maintains a global list of ports behind which a multicast\nrouter resides. The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure\nmulticast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not\nmember in the matching MDB entry.\n\nWhen per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast\ncontext is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global\nrouter port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN\nmulticast snooping is enabled:\n\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n\nSince commit 4b30ae9adb04 (\"net: bridge: mcast: re-implement\nbr_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions\"), when per-VLAN multicast\nsnooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the\nper-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one.

This can also happen due to IP reassembly: skbs\nwith a secpath remain on the reassembly queue until netns\ndestruction. If we can't guarantee that the queues are flushed by the\ntime xfrm_state_fini runs, there may still be references to a (user)\nxfrm_state, preventing the timely deletion of the corresponding\nfallback state.\n\nInstead of chasing each instance of skbs holding a secpath one by one,\nthis patch fixes the issue directly within xfrm, by deleting the\nfallback state as soon as the last user state depending on it has been\ndeleted. Destruction will still happen when the final reference is\ndropped.\n\nA separate lockdep class for the fallback state is required since\nwe're going to lock x-\u003etunnel while x is locked."

It is\ndue to a race condition between learning still happening and a port being\ndeleted, after all its fdbs have been flushed. The port's state has been\ntoggled to disabled so no learning should happen at that time, but if we\nhave MST enabled, it will bypass the port's state, that together with VLAN\nfiltering disabled can lead to fdb learning at a time when it shouldn't\nhappen while the port is being deleted. VLAN filtering must be disabled\nbecause we flush the port VLANs when it's being deleted which will stop\nlearning.

For attributes that control queue limits, the\nstore operation will also lock the queue limits with a call to\nqueue_limits_start_update(). However, some drivers (e.g. SCSI sd) may\nneed to issue commands to a device to obtain limit values from the\nhardware with the queue limits locked. This creates a potential ABBA\ndeadlock situation if a user attempts to modify a limit (thus freezing\nthe device queue) while the device driver starts a revalidation of the\ndevice queue limits.\n\nAvoid such deadlock by not freezing the queue before calling the\n-\u003estore_limit() method in struct queue_sysfs_entry and instead use the\nqueue_limits_commit_update_frozen helper to freeze the queue after taking\nthe limits lock.\n\nThis also removes taking the sysfs lock for the store_limit method as\nit doesn't protect anything here, but creates even more nesting.\nHopefully it will go away from the actual sysfs methods entirely soon.\n\n(commit log adapted from a similar patch from  Damien Le Moal)"

If it runs out\nof bus numbers, no pci_bus is allocated and the \"subordinate\" pointer in\nthe bridge's pci_dev remains NULL.\n\nThe PCIe bandwidth controller erroneously does not check for a NULL\nsubordinate pointer and dereferences it on probe.\n\nBandwidth control of unusable devices below the bridge is of questionable\nutility, so simply error out instead.  This mirrors what PCIe hotplug does\nsince commit 62e4492c3063 (\"PCI: Prevent NULL dereference during pciehp\nprobe\").\n\nThe PCI core emits a message with KERN_INFO severity if it has run out of\nbus numbers.

Consequently the\nmodule 'vpa_pmu' can be unloaded while one of the perf-events are still\nactive, which can lead to kernel oops and panic of the form below on a\nPseries-LPAR:\n\nBUG: Kernel NULL pointer dereference on read at 0x00000058\n\u003csnip\u003e\n NIP [c000000000506cb8] event_sched_out+0x40/0x258\n LR [c00000000050e8a4] __perf_remove_from_context+0x7c/0x2b0\n Call Trace:\n [c00000025fc3fc30] [c00000025f8457a8] 0xc00000025f8457a8 (unreliable)\n [c00000025fc3fc80] [fffffffffffffee0] 0xfffffffffffffee0\n [c00000025fc3fcd0] [c000000000501e70] event_function+0xa8/0x120\n\u003csnip\u003e\n Kernel panic - not syncing: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!\n\nFix this by adding the module ownership to 'vpa_pmu' so that the module\n'vpa_pmu' is ref-counted and prevented from being unloaded when perf-events\nare initialized."

If one of the\nlocks aren't readily available, it may lead to dropping the current\nrunqueue lock and reacquiring both the locks at once. During this window\nit is possible that the task is already migrated and is running on some\nother CPU. These cases are already handled. However, if the task is\nmigrated and has already been executed and another CPU is now trying to\nwake it up (ttwu) such that it is queued again on the runqeue\n(on_rq is 1) and also if the task was run by the same CPU, then the\ncurrent checks will pass even though the task was migrated out and is no\nlonger in the pushable tasks list.\n\nCrashes\n=======\nThis bug resulted in quite a few flavors of crashes triggering kernel\npanics with various crash signatures such as assert failures, page\nfaults, null pointer dereferences, and queue corruption errors all\ncoming from scheduler itself.\n\nSome of the crashes:\n-\u003e kernel BUG at kernel/sched/rt.c:1616!

The problem is that kernel page tables are modified without\nflushing corresponding TLB entries.\n\nEven if it looks like the empty flush_tlb_all() implementation on s390 is\nthe problem, it is actually a different problem: on s390 it is not allowed\nto replace an active/valid page table entry with another valid page table\nentry without the detour over an invalid entry. A direct replacement may\nlead to random crashes and/or data corruption.\n\nIn order to invalidate an entry special instructions have to be used\n(e.g. ipte or idte). Alternatively there are also special instructions\navailable which allow to replace a valid entry with a different valid\nentry (e.g. crdte or cspg).\n\nGiven that the HVO code currently does not provide the hooks to allow for\nan implementation which is compliant with the s390 architecture\nrequirements, disable ARCH_WANT_OPTIMIZE_HUGETLB_VMEMMAP again, which is\nbasically a revert of the original patch which enabled it."

                "text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nveth: more robust handing of race to avoid txq getting stuck\n\nCommit dc82a33297fc (\"veth: apply qdisc backpressure on full ptr_ring to\nreduce TX drops\") introduced a race condition that can lead to a permanently\nstalled TXQ. This was observed in production on ARM64 systems (Ampere Altra\nMax).\n\nThe race occurs in veth_xmit(). The producer observes a full ptr_ring and\nstops the queue (netif_tx_stop_queue()). The subsequent conditional logic,\nintended to re-wake the queue if the consumer had just emptied it (if\n(__ptr_ring_empty(...)) netif_tx_wake_queue()), can fail. This leads to a\n\"lost wakeup\" where the TXQ remains stopped (QUEUE_STATE_DRV_XOFF) and\ntraffic halts.\n\nThis failure is caused by an incorrect use of the __ptr_ring_empty() API\nfrom the producer side. As noted in kernel comments, this check is not\nguaranteed to be correct if a consumer is operating on another CPU. The\nempty test is based on ptr_ring-\u003econsumer_head, making it reliable only for\nthe consumer. Using this check from the producer side is fundamentally racy.\n\nThis patch fixes the race by adopting the more robust logic from an earlier\nversion V4 of the patchset, which always flushed the peer:\n\n(1) In veth_xmit(), the racy conditional wake-up logic and its memory barrier\nare removed. Instead, after stopping the queue, we unconditionally call\n__veth_xdp_flush(rq). This guarantees that the NAPI consumer is scheduled,\nmaking it solely responsible for re-waking the TXQ.\n  This handles the race where veth_poll() consumes all packets and completes\nNAPI *before* veth_xmit() on the producer side has called netif_tx_stop_queue.\nThe __veth_xdp_flush(rq) will observe rx_notify_masked is false and schedule\nNAPI.\n\n(2) On the consumer side, the logic for waking the peer TXQ is moved out of\nveth_xdp_rcv() and placed at the end of the veth_poll() function. This\nplacement is part of fixing the race, as the netif_tx_queue_stopped() check\nmust occur after rx_notify_masked is potentially set to false during NAPI\ncompletion.\n  This handles the race where veth_poll() consumes all packets, but haven't\nfinished (rx_notify_masked is still true).
