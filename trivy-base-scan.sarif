                "text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/rt: Fix race in push_rt_task\n\nOverview\n========\nWhen a CPU chooses to call push_rt_task and picks a task to push to\nanother CPU's runqueue then it will call find_lock_lowest_rq method\nwhich would take a double lock on both CPUs' runqueues. If one of the\nlocks aren't readily available, it may lead to dropping the current\nrunqueue lock and reacquiring both the locks at once.

                "text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: don't log conflicting inode if it's a dir moved in the current transaction\n\nWe can't log a conflicting inode if it's a directory and it was moved\nfrom one parent directory to another parent directory in the current\ntransaction, as this can result an attempt to have a directory with\ntwo hard links during log replay, one for the old parent directory and\nanother for the new parent directory.\n\nThe following scenario triggers that issue:\n\n1) We have directories \"dir1\" and \"dir2\" created in a past transaction.\n   Directory \"dir1\" has inode A as its parent directory;\n\n2) We move \"dir1\" to some other directory;\n\n3) We create a file with the name \"dir1\" in directory inode A;\n\n4) We fsync the new file. This results in logging the inode of the new file\n   and the inode for the directory \"dir1\" that was previously moved in the\n   current transaction. So the log tree has the INODE_REF item for the\n   new location of \"dir1\";\n\n5) We move the new file to some other directory. This results in updating\n   the log tree to included the new INODE_REF for the new location of the\n   file and removes the INODE_REF for the old location. This happens\n   during the rename when we call btrfs_log_new_name();\n\n6) We fsync the file, and that persists the log tree changes done in the\n   previous step (btrfs_log_new_name() only updates the log tree in\n   memory);\n\n7) We have a power failure;\n\n8) Next time the fs is mounted, log replay happens and when processing\n   the inode for directory \"dir1\" we find a new INODE_REF and add that\n   link, but we don't remove the old link of the inode since we have\n   not logged the old parent directory of the directory inode \"dir1\".\n\nAs a result after log replay finishes when we trigger writeback of the\nsubvolume tree's extent buffers, the tree check will detect that we have\na directory a hard link count of 2 and we get a mount failure.\nThe errors and stack traces reported in dmesg/syslog are like this:\n\n   [ 3845.729764] BTRFS info (device dm-0): start tree-log replay\n   [ 3845.730304] page: refcount:3 mapcount:0 mapping:000000005c8a3027 index:0x1d00 pfn:0x11510c\n   [ 3845.731236] memcg:ffff9264c02f4e00\n   [ 3845.731751] aops:btree_aops [btrfs] ino:1\n   [ 3845.732300] flags: 0x17fffc00000400a(uptodate|private|writeback|node=0|zone=2|lastcpupid=0x1ffff)\n   [ 3845.733346] raw: 017fffc00000400a 0000000000000000 dead000000000122 ffff9264d978aea8\n   [ 3845.734265] raw: 0000000000001d00 ffff92650e6d4738 00000003ffffffff ffff9264c02f4e00\n   [ 3845.735305] page dumped because: eb page dump\n   [ 3845.735981] BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupt leaf: root=5 block=30408704 slot=6 ino=257, invalid nlink: has 2 expect no more than 1 for dir\n   [ 3845.737786] BTRFS info (device dm-0): leaf 30408704 gen 10 total ptrs 17 free space 14881 owner 5\n   [ 3845.737789] BTRFS info (device dm-0): refs 4 lock_owner 0 current 30701\n   [ 3845.737792] \titem 0 key (256 INODE_ITEM 0) itemoff 16123 itemsize 160\n   [ 3845.737794] \t\tinode generation 3 transid 9 size 16 nbytes 16384\n   [ 3845.737795] \t\tblock group 0 mode 40755 links 1 uid 0 gid 0\n   [ 3845.737797] \t\trdev 0 sequence 2 flags 0x0\n   [ 3845.737798] \t\tatime 1764259517.0\n   [ 3845.737800] \t\tctime 1764259517.572889464\n   [ 3845.737801] \t\tmtime 1764259517.572889464\n   [ 3845.737802] \t\totime 1764259517.0\n   [ 3845.737803] \titem 1 key (256 INODE_REF 256) itemoff 16111 itemsize 12\n   [ 3845.737805] \t\tindex 0 name_len 2\n   [ 3845.737807] \titem 2 key (256 DIR_ITEM 2363071922) itemoff 16077 itemsize 34\n   [ 3845.737808] \t\tlocation key (257 1 0) type 2\n   [ 3845.737810] \t\ttransid 9 data_len 0 name_len 4\n   [ 3845.737811] \titem 3 key (256 DIR_ITEM 2676584006) itemoff 16043 itemsize 34\n   [ 3845.737813] \t\tlocation key (258 1 0) type 2\n   [ 3845.737814] \t\ttransid 9 data_len 0 name_len 4\n   [ 3845.737815] \titem 4 key (256 DIR_INDEX 2) itemoff 16009 itemsize 34\n   [ 3845.737816] \t\tlocation key (257 1 0) type 2\n   [\n---truncated---"

This code path eventually calls fib_compute_spec_dst()\nwhich dereferences skb-\u003edev. An attempt was made to fix the NULL skb-\u003edev\ndereference in commit 0113d9c9d1cc (\"ipv4: fix null-deref in\nipv4_link_failure\"), but it only addressed the immediate dev_net(skb-\u003edev)\ndereference by using a fallback device.

This preload\ncache is subject to periodic eviction — typically after every 256 context\nswitches — to remove old entry.\n\nTo optimize performance, the kernel skips switch_mmu_context() in\nswitch_mm_irqs_off() when the prev and next mm_struct are the same.\nHowever, on hash MMU systems, this can lead to inconsistencies between\nthe hardware SLB and the software preload cache.\n\nIf an SLB entry for a process is evicted from the software cache on one\nCPU, and the same process later runs on another CPU without executing\nswitch_mmu_context(), the hardware SLB may retain stale entries. If the\nkernel then attempts to reload that entry, it can trigger an SLB\nmulti-hit error.\n\nThe following timeline shows how stale SLB entries are created and can\ncause a multi-hit error when a process moves between CPUs without a\nMMU context switch.\n\nCPU 0                                   CPU 1\n-----                                    -----\nProcess P\nexec                                    swapper/1\n load_elf_binary\n  begin_new_exc\n    activate_mm\n     switch_mm_irqs_off\n      switch_mmu_context\n       switch_slb\n       /*\n        * This invalidates all\n        * the entries in the HW\n        * and setup the new HW\n        * SLB entries as per the\n        * preload cache.\n        */\ncontext_switch\nsched_migrate_task migrates process P to cpu-1\n\nProcess swapper/0                       context switch (to process P)\n(uses mm_struct of Process P)           switch_mm_irqs_off()\n                                         switch_slb\n                                           load_slb++\n                                            /*\n                                            * load_slb becomes 0 here\n                                            * and we evict an entry from\n                                            * the preload cache with\n                                            * preload_age().

At the same\ntime, the code in ftrace assumes that no more than 2 instructions can\nbe generated, which is why it stores them in an int[2] array. However,\nas previously noted, the macro UASM_i_LA_mostly (and now UASM_i_LA)\ncauses a buffer overflow when _mcount is beyond 32 bits. This leads to\ncorruption of the variables located in the __read_mostly section.\n\nThis corruption was observed because the variable\n__cpu_primary_thread_mask was corrupted, causing a hang very early\nduring boot.\n\nThis fix prevents the corruption by avoiding the generation of\ninstructions if they could exceed 2 instructions in\nlength. Fortunately, insn_la_mcount is only used if the instrumented\ncode is located outside the kernel code section, so dynamic ftrace can\nstill be used, albeit in a more limited scope. This is still\npreferable to corrupting memory and/or crashing the kernel."

If eb_add_vma() fails, neither the current nor\nthe next vma is set to NULL, which is a source of a NULL deref bug\ndescribed in the issue linked in the Closes tag.\n\nWhen entering eb_lookup_vmas(), the vma pointers are set to the slab\npoison value, instead of NULL.

The issue occurs\nwhen the DMA buffer is freed by tegra_adma_terminate_all() before the\nvchan completion tasklet finishes accessing it.\n\nThe race condition follows this sequence:\n\n  1. DMA transfer completes, triggering an interrupt that schedules the\n     completion tasklet (tasklet has not executed yet)\n  2.

Accordingly, the code transfers\ntruesize from the parent to the newly created segments.\n\nPrior to commit ed4cccef64c1 (\"gro: fix ownership transfer\"), this\ntruesize subtraction in skb_segment_list() was valid because fragments\nstill carry a reference to the original socket.\n\nHowever, commit ed4cccef64c1 (\"gro: fix ownership transfer\") changed\nthis behavior by ensuring that fraglist entries are explicitly\norphaned (skb-\u003esk = NULL) to prevent illegal orphaning later in the\nstack. This change meant that the entire socket memory charge remained\nwith the head SKB, but the corresponding accounting logic in\nskb_segment_list() was never updated.\n\nAs a result, the current code unconditionally adds each fragment's\ntruesize to delta_truesize and subtracts it from the parent SKB. Since\nthe fragments are no longer charged to the socket, this subtraction\nresults in an effective under-count of memory when the head is freed.\nThis causes sk_wmem_alloc to remain non-zero, preventing socket\ndestruction and leading to a persistent memory leak.\n\nThe leak can be observed via KMEMLEAK when tearing down the networking\nenvironment:\n\nunreferenced object 0xffff8881e6eb9100 (size 2048):\n  comm \"ping\", pid 6720, jiffies 4295492526\n  backtrace:\n    kmem_cache_alloc_noprof+0x5c6/0x800\n    sk_prot_alloc+0x5b/0x220\n    sk_alloc+0x35/0xa00\n    inet6_create.part.0+0x303/0x10d0\n    __sock_create+0x248/0x640\n    __sys_socket+0x11b/0x1d0\n\nSince skb_segment_list() is exclusively used for SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST\npackets constructed by GRO, the truesize adjustment is removed.\n\nThe call to skb_release_head_state() must be preserved. As documented in\ncommit cf673ed0e057 (\"net: fix fraglist segmentation reference count\nleak\"), it is still required to correctly drop references to SKB\nextensions that may be overwritten during __copy_skb_header()."

An unprivileged attacker can hide a process from procps-ng's utilities by exploiting a race condition in reading /proc/PID entries. This vulnerability affects procps and procps-ng up to version 3.3.15, newer versions might be affected also."
